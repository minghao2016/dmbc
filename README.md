###### Current release: 0.2.1
###### R version required: at least 3.5.0
`R` package for Bayesian model-based clustering of several dissimilarity
matrices.

Since the package requires some code to be compiled, you need a working C++
compiler. To get it:

- On Windows, install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
- On Mac, install Xcode from the app store.
- On Linux, `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev` or similar.

See the help pages of the `dmbc()` and `dmbc_IC()` functions for some examples
or have a look at the demos in the package.
