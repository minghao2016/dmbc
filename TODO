- the simulated chains should be converted to class “mcmc”

- summary should be more flexible

- add functions for checking convergence (see the coda package)

- plot methods should include a logical argument 'burnin' to include or not the burnin period in the graphs

- use the vector library or try using Rcpp

- replace the current relabel algorithm with a faster one (e.g. Fruhwirth-Schnatter)
